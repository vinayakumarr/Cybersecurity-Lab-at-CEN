## Cybersecurity group at CEN

### (Cybersecurity lab @ CEN)

Centre for Excellence in Computational Engineering and Networking ([CEN](https://www.amrita.edu/center/computational-engineering-and-networking))

[Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/).

Cybersecurity group at CEN is organizing a shared task in Cybersecurity domain. More details avilable at [DMD2018](http://nlp.amrita.edu/DMD2018/)

Cybersecurity group at CEN understand the underlying mathematics knowledge required to apply Machine learning to Cyber Security tasks at Scale.

The ability to digitize our lives has outpaced our ability to stay safe. One of the biggest challenges is to understand the volume, velocity and complexity of threatening activity inside the network. We call this cyber intelligence. We have been developing a self-learning intelligence system by understanding the mathematics and using the most advanced machine learning technologies such as deep learning. A self-learning intelligence system learns a unique pattern of normal and abnormal activities of every device and user on a network, and correlates these insights in order to spot emerging threats that would otherwise go unnoticed. Cybersecurity group is fortunate to have Cyber Security experts and Researchers who have constantly smell the developments in Natural language processing, Image processing, Speech recognition and many other areas and incorporate those novel approaches to self-learning system to enhance the system detection rate of malicious activities. We are involved in developing large scale Security projects that involves Big-data Security Intelligence, Cyber-Physical systems security, Machine learning for Security, Complex Binary analysis, IoT, SCADA and Hardware security, Application & Network security, Advanced Forensics and Incident handling. Some of the tasks that we think and solve daily are to apply various Data mining, Machine learning and Deep learning approaches to various Cyber Security tasks such as Traffic Analysis, Intrusion detection, Malware Analysis, Botnet Analysis, Anonymity Services, Domain Generation Algorithms, Advanced mathematics to Crypto Systems.

We strongly believe in open science and reproducible research and actively publish tool and code on [Github](https://github.com/SecCEN)
